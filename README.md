!!!NOTICE!!!   !!!NOTICE!!!    !!!NOTICE!!!
This script has now been **replaced** with a MUCH simplier but also MUCH faster script using "smartctl" instead of SNMP. 

It can be found here: https://github.com/wallacebrf/SMART-to-InfluxDB-Logger


This script using SNMP took 1 minute and 22 seconds to execute on a Synology NAS with 9x HDDs and no NVME drives. The new version using smartctl takes seconds.
